# votest

A virtual protest app

## Idea
 - Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, protest became difficut and potentially dangerous. This app is an attemp to create a platform where people can safely excercise their rights. 
 - For the traditional way of protesting, one can't never know if their ideas are widely supported or not. Now with this app, people can see in real-time the amount of people who are with or against their ideas.
