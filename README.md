# votest

A virtual protest app

## Idea
 - Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, protest became difficult and potentially dangerous. This app is an attempt to create a platform where people can safely exercise their rights.
 - For the traditional way of protesting, one can't never know if their ideas are widely supported or not. Now with this app, people can see in real-time the amount of people who are with or against their ideas.
